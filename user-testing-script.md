## Introduction
Hi [Name of Tester],

Thank you so much for taking the time to join today. I know there was some set up for this on your end, I hope you didn’t have too many troubles. 

My name is [Your Name] and I’m going to be walking you through this testing session today. You probably already know why we’ve asked you here, but let me go through it briefly. 

We’re asking people to try using [Name of Website], so we can see whether it works as intended. The session should take about [Time]. The first thing I want to make clear is that we are testing the website, not you. You can’t make any mistakes here and you can’t hurt anyone’s feelings. We are doing this to improve the website and want to hear your honest reactions.

As you use the website, I’m going to ask you as much as possible to try and think out loud: to say what you are looking at, what you’re trying to do, and what you are thinking. This will be a big help to.

I will prompt you with some testing scenarios and guide you with questions along the way. If you have any questions as we go along, feel free to ask them. I may not be able to answer them right away since we are interested in how people would move through the website without help.

With your permission we are going to record the screen and our conversation. The recording will only be used to improve the website, and it won’t be seen by anyone except those people working on the project.

Does that all make sense? Do you have any questions before we start?

#### Intro Questions: 

Before we begin, I’d like to ask you just a few quick questions.
- Where are you employed and what is your role? 
- Are you familiar with this company or have you used this application before? 
- How much time do you spend per day using the internet at work and at home? 
- [Other Relevant Questions] 

## Session
First I’ll get you to open up the [Name of Website] and we’ll start on the home screen. Look at the first screen and tell me what you make of it, and what you think you can do here.

Now I’m going to ask you to try doing some specific tasks. I’ll read each one outloud. And again, as much as possible, it will help us if you can try and think out loud as you go along.

#### Testing Scenarios:

#### Final Questions:

Now that we are done the tasks I'm going to ask you some final questions:
- How was your experience?
- What was the most challenging?
- What’s the next thing you would want added to the app?
- Any other questions or thoughts?

Thanks so much for joining us today. That was exactly what we needed and was very helpful.
