# What is User Testing & How Do I Do it?

User testing is an excellent way to gain valuable insights into what is working and what isn’t working on a website or application.

Should I user test? You are not the user, so yes, you should test. First it’s important to understand the variety of different types of user testing you could perform.

## Types of Testing

#### Usability Tests
Usability tests are a qualitative form of testing that involves getting users in front of a wireframe, prototype or live product to get feedback on whether the assumptions made are correct. 

#### User Interviews, Focus Groups & Question Based Surveys
All are other forms of qualitative feedback gathering. Information gathering and/or getting feedback by allowing users to walkthrough current processes are useful ways to help inform design decisions.

#### Eye Tracking, Card Sorting and Data Based Surveys
These quantitative forms of feedback happen at larger quantities, and can give you metrics that allow you to gage the effectiveness of how users are finding information.

## Picking What and When to Test
Whether it’s a site architecture, static wireframe, clickable prototype or launchable product, test early and as often as you can. Below are some examples of tests you could perform and when you could perform them in our process.

#### Usability Test an Existing Product
If the client has an existing website or application you can test it in the early stage of a project to get insights on current user pain points.

**When:** Discovery Phase <br>
**How:** Google Meet can be used for the majority of testing that can’t be performed in-person. For more robust needs such as the moderated testing of mobile apps or any unmoderated testing LookBack offers a variety of needs.

#### Interview Users
If there are internal or external workflows that need unpacking, user interviews or question based surveys can be a great way to gain that feedback. It can also be valuable to watch a user walk through their current processes, whether online or offline, to gain insights that they may not be able to verbalize.

**When:** Discovery Phase <br>
**How:** Perform interviews in-person or via Google Meet and send a survey through Google Forms.

#### Track an Information Architecture or Workflow
When developing the first draft of an information architecture or workflow it can be helpful to get metrics on how easily users move through it. Performing a Tree Testing or Card Sorting study are just some of the ways you can get that data.

**When:** Discovery Phase <br>
**How:** Use Optimal Workshop for any quantitative testing.

#### Usability Test a Wireframe or Prototype
In the early stage of Production, it can be important to test the wireframes or prototypes for any primary user flows before your team gets too far into development.

**When:** Early in the Production Phase <br>
**How:** Google Meet can be used for the majority of testing that can’t be performed in-person. For more robust needs such as the moderated testing of mobile apps or any unmoderated testing LookBack offers a variety of needs.

#### Usability Test a Completed Product
Testing near the end of production phase can again ensure that the correct assumptions have been made. If testing was completed on the existing product you can use these insights to compare outputs as well as ensure no changes need to be made before launch or before a second phase of the product has started. Ensure you have the right amount of budget accounted so that you can make changes to the product after the testing.

**When:** End of the Production Phase <br>
**How:** Google Meet can be used for the majority of testing that can’t be performed in-person. For more robust needs such as the moderated testing of mobile apps or any unmoderated testing LookBack offers a variety of needs.

Do I need to do all of these tests? Probably not.

## Deciding When to Test
It’s not always going to be possible to perform all five of the above tests, nor will it be useful to. It’s important that the testing you do will optimize solving problems for the key workflows. Decide what to test early in the project, so that you save budget for it (ie. don’t test close to dev complete if you have no budget to make those changes after testing.)

Some questions to ask yourself when deciding when to test:
- What are our testing goals?
- What do we need to know?
- What is the most important task that users need to complete?
- Would testing here help solve key problems or workflows?
- What test would be the most useful to us?
- What is our timeline?
- What is our budget?

For example, if the most important flow is that users are able to easily find the right information, then doing Tree Testing to find holes in the information architecture would be beneficial. If an admin user has large workflow issue on their current internal dashboard, having them walk you through the existing processes would help inform the new processes you develop. If you have an idea for a key workflow and want to see how users move through it, then perform a usability test. Once you’ve decided what to test and how, then it’s important to recruit the right users.

## Recruiting Testers

Check with the client and see if they can help reach out to possible testers. It might seem obvious, but it’s important to try and test with actual users of the product. This doesn’t mean that people who aren’t from your target audience won’t give you good feedback, but you need to be aware that they will probably create a number of false positives.

How many users should I get?

- Qualitative and insight gathering driven feedback, interviews or usability tests, require 3-5 testers. Any more than 5 users answering the same questions or performing the same tasks will give you diminishing returns.
- Quantitative and data driven feedback, tree testing, card sorting, or rating surveys, require 20-30 users.

## Prepping & Running Testing

#### Tree Testing & Data Based Tests
Larger scale testing, like Tree Testing, that take no moderating and less of a tester’s time, require less formal setup. Once you’ve developed the test using Optimal Workshop get feedback internally and with the client before distributing to users.

You’ll need to work with the client beforehand to make sure that it is distributed through the right channels. Channels could include social media platforms or having the client directly reach out to users through their email platform. Make sure to ensure that the test is distributed as widely as possible and that it gets into the hands of the core user groups. For example, if the client’s website will be multilingual, then make sure you distribute the test in both languages and to corresponding users.

#### Usability Sessions & Interviews
Interviews or testing sessions require more of a time commitment and setup for testers. Once you or the client has found users to test with, it’s important to book the session in their calendar and then email them ahead of time to let them know what to expect during the session. You’ll also need to let them know what setup needs to be done beforehand and what requirements we will need from them during the testing (ie. recording, screen sharing, prep work, etc.).

## Documenting Recommendations & Making Changes

Once testing is complete you should present your findings and recommended changes to the client before moving on and making changes to the product. Doing this will ensure that the client has no existing business rules that could interfere with making a change.

Now it’s time to put the testing to use! Work with your team to prioritize the product changes before you implement them.

Then test again!
