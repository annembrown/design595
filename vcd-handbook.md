# Visual Communication Design (VCD) Handbook
**Student Information | Fall 2022**

Our program includes aspects of communication design, typography,
imagemaking, illustration and interactive media for the creation of
visual communications, as well as design principles, theories and
research methods.

## General aims of the program
- To foster the development of visual awareness, sensitivity and
creativity as important aspects of general education
- To acquaint students with graphic design, electronic media,
typography, photography and image-making in the context of
creative experimentation and applied communication
- To instruct in basic skills and techniques, to foster competence in
the use of materials and equipment, and to explore new techniques,
materials, equipment and media
- To research, collate, organize and analyse information, to critically
examine facts, ideas, concepts and feelings and to develop
and evaluate appropriate visual media and forms facilitating
communication. Personal, social, economic, aesthetic and
environmental factors are considered

## Program outline
Des 393/4, 493/4, and 593/4 courses provide an introduction to
general principles and theories demonstrated ithrough carefully
selected projects. Additional courses (395, 396, 483, 495, 496,
497, 498, 595, 596, 597) concentrate on specific aspects, such as
perception, systems, design issues, research, methods, management
and media. Spring session and practicum courses offer additional
opportunities for learning.

First year projects are intended to cover a wide spectrum of
techniques, principles and media. The emphasis at this stage is on
acquiring skills and discrimination relative to visual design.
Throughout the program there are opportunities for further conceptual
and visual exploration and professional practice. Considerable work
outside class, in addition to studio work, is necessary in order to get
results.

Students intending to pursue professional careers in design or teaching
are advised to continue their studies in a graduate program in design
after a few years of professional practice.

Des 600/1 and 680/1 comprise the core courses of the Master
of Design (MDes) graduate program and are followed by a year of
thesis research.

## Grading, expectations and evaluation
Course content and expectations will be discussed at the beginning of
each course. Each project is due and is discussed within the class, at a
date set at the time that the project is announced. At the end of each
course all work must be submitted in a portfolio for review. Instructors
will supply the exact details for each course, and each instructor
is responsible for grades assigned in his/her class. Opportunity
for personal interviews is given at the end of each term; a verbal
assessment of the students’ progress is made at this time.

### Grading

The official University 4-point grading system will be implemented in
evaluating student assignments and general performance, including
participation. Individual course components will be weighted as
outlined per course to translate term marks into a final letter grade.
Your grade will be determined on the basis of your individual progress
in researching, planning, conceptualizing, producing, documenting and
evaluating your solutions, as well as your punctual attendance in and
contribution to the class.

You will be allowed a reasonable time in which to complete an
assignment, bearing in mind its weight. All course assignments to be
handed in for marking will be returned within a reasonable amount of
time provided that you have submitted them by the due date. When
assessing written work, quality of expression and composition will be
considered.

Generally, projects will be assessed individually and in combination
within the portfolio presentation. Instructors will supply the exact
details for each course, and each instructor is responsible for grades
assigned in his/her class. Grades reflect judgements of student
achievement made by insructors, based on a combination of absolute
achievement and relative performance in class.

Final grades are unofficial until they are registered with the Registrar’s
office. Any assessment is valid only for the period to which it refers.

| Descriptor | Letter Grade | Grade Point |
|  -----  | ----- | ----- | 
| Excellent | A+ A A- | 4.0 / 4.0 / 3.7 | 
| Good | B+ B B- | 3.3 / 3.0 / 2.7 | 
| Satisfactory | C+ C C- | 2.3 / 2.0 / 1.7 | 
| Minimal Pass | D+ D | 
| Fail | F |

Students need a grade of B (3.0) averaged between the pre-requisite
classes to proceed to the next level in studio classes (i.e. from 300- to
400-level). Keep in mind that grades received this year and in previous
years can affect registration in spring/summer and fall/winter courses.
BDes students require a GPA of 2.7 (B-) over all fall and winter courses
to be promoted to the next academic year. MDes students must obtain a
minimum grade of 3.0 (B) to pass a course, and must achieve a GPA of 2.7
(B-) in their coursework to proceed to thesis.
“Students may not repeat any University course passed or courses for
which they have received transfer credit...” (§ 22.1.3).

### Criteria for assessment
- Quality achieved in terms of creativity, inquiry, effectiveness,
writing, technical competence, attention to requirements and
presentation, for individual pieces and the total body of work
- Individual progress considering previous knowledge and background
- Effort extended; e.g. attendance, time spent additional to class
hours, participation in discussions and critiques
- Attitudes towards classmates, staff, course work and deadlines
- Handling of materials; use and care of facilities

### Attendance and deadline expectations
Your regular attendance during class times, participation in discussions
and timely completion of assignments are essential to the successful
completion of your courses. Work assigned must be ready for the
discussion or critique date.

Students who choose not to attend class must assume whatever risks
are involved (see Calendar section 23.3 and 23.5.6). Attendance in
studio disciplines is mandatory. It is your responsibility to make up for
lost time and missed information.

**Every three unexcused absences will result in a step reductionof the
final grade (i.e. B to B-). Late projects will carry a one-time penalty
of a letter grade step, unless specified differently.**

Group discussions of work give students insights and knowledge
in direct proportion to their input. To avoid repetition, notes should
be kept and brought to classes. Never hesitate to ask questions if in
doubt. Attention to personal concerns will be given, but no private
lessons can be expected in cases of lateness or arbitrary absence.
Contact your instructor or Caitlin Wells, student advisor (ccwells@ualberta.
ca), as soon as possible if you have extenuating circumstances that might
result in missing classes or might necessitate a portfolio extension.

### Student work and portfolios
Students are responsible for the safekeeping of their materials, equipment
and work produced. You are expected to maintain a system for your
design notes as a resource for documenting and reflecting on concepts
and research, as well as an information storage and retrieval system to
manage reference and project materials.

Throughout the course you will work towards a final portfolio
presentation, unified through application of your own visual
identity system.

As this course does not have a final examination, the original or a
reproduction of at least one substantial piece of term work may be
retained for possible review in the case of a grade appeal.

### Changes to course outlines
Circumstances may develop during the term where a change to the
course outline (as set out in Section 61.6(a) of the GFC Policy Manual
makes sense to all concerned. Such changes shall only occur with fair
warning or general class consent. Policy about course outlines can be
found in § 23.4(2) of the University Calendar. (GFC 29 SEP 2003).

### Student concerns and information
Refer to ‘Undergraduate Programs’ on the Art & Design website
If you have a concern about any aspect of a course, you are advised
to consult, in turn, the instructor, the Coordinator, the Director of
Undergraduate Studies, the Chair of the Department of Art and Design
and the Dean of the Faculty of Arts.

### Academic integrity
“The University of Alberta is committed to the highest standards of
academic integrity and honesty. Students are expected to be familiar
with these standards regarding academic honesty and to uphold the
policies of the University in this respect. Students are particularly urged to
familiarize themselves with the Code of Student Behavior (www.ualberta.ca/governance/media-library/documents/resources/policies-standardsand-
codes-of-conduct/cosb-updated-july-1-2019.pdf) and avoid any
behavior which could potentially result in suspicions of cheating, plagiarism,
misrepresentation of facts and/or participation in an offence.

Academic dishonesty is a serious offence and can result in suspension
or expulsion from the University.” “No student shall represent another’s
substantial editorial or compositional assistance on an assignment as their
own. No student shall submit in any course or program of study, without
the written approval of the course instructor; all or a substantial portion of
any academic writing, essay, thesis, research report, project assignment,
presentation or poster for which credit has been obtained by the student or
