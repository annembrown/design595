# How to Run a Usability Testing Session

Usability testing involves getting 3-5 users in front of a wireframe, prototype or live product to get feedback on whether the assumptions made are correct. Whether you choose to perform the session in person or remotely, your goal during is to gather as much feedback as you possibly can. This helps you to identify any design issues before moving forward.

Below contains information on how to prep for and conduct a usability session.

## Before the Session
Once you or the client has found users to test with, it’s important book the session in their calendar and then email them ahead of time to let them know what to expect during the session. You’ll also need to let them know what set up needs to be done beforehand and what requirements we will need from them during the testing (ie. recording, screen sharing, prep work, etc.). 

#### Create Scenarios
If you are going to watch people try to use a product you’ve got to give them something to do. First, choose the tasks to test—the things you wants them to try to do.

**Example Tasks:**
- Book an appointment online.
- Find a doctor.
- Cancel an appointment.

Next, you need to expand each task into a scenario—little scripts that give the tester any details of context that they need to know how to do the task.

**Example Scenario:** <br>
*"You need to book a physical therapy appointment for your 11-year old son. It needs to be after schools and he gets out at 2pm. Book the appointment online."*

Run your chosen scenarios by your internal team and the client before proceeding to the sessions.

## During the Session

Testing sessions should run no longer than one hour for each session. Each session requires a moderator, note taker and tester. You can also encourage someone from the client’s team to observe the session. This first hand experience can help them better understand their users and will help validate the recommendations you later make.

As a facilitator of a user testing session your job is to:
- Tell the the participants what to do, keeping them moving and keeping them happy.
- Get the participants to verbalize their thoughts as they use the application.

#### Script & Agenda
Begin each session by reading the first part of the Testing Script. You can make minor changes to the script before the first session, but shouldn’t change the meaning or order of items. While in the session, you might have the instinct to improvise to make it sound more natural, but reading directly from the script ensures that each participant gets the same experience.

The script contains the following order of events:
1. Introduction. Meet the user and give them the context they need to do the testing and feel comfortable.
2. Recording Warning. Let the user know youwill be recodrinf the session and it will only be used by your project team.
3. Pre Test Questions. Get any information you need to “grade on a curve” and also start to get the tester talking.
4. First Impressions. Ask the user what the they think of the landing screen. Not what their opinion is, but what they think the application is used for.
5. Tasks & Scenarios. Read the first scenario out loud and have the tester perform the task. Then do the same for the second, and so on.
6. Post Test Questions. End the session by getting them to summarize their experience.
7. Thank Them. Show appreciation in a way that lets them know it was a helpful experience.

Uses this Example Script and Scenarios as a starting point.

#### Ask Probing Questions
You want to encourage participants to think out loud as much as possible. The combination of watching them use the application and hearing what they are thinking will really allow you to see the experience through their eyes.

Below are some probing questions that can help get testers to think out loud:
- What do you think ________ means?
- How would you find ________?
- What do you expect to see when you click on ________?
- What are you thinking?
- Why did you click there?
- Is that what you expected to happen?
- Can you try doing it another way?
- That’s great, very helpful. I want to move us along, since we have more to do.

## After the Session
Once testing is complete you should present your findings and recommended changes to the client before moving on and making changes to the product. Doing this will ensure that the client has no existing business rules that could interfere with making a change. 

Now it’s time to put the testing to use! Work with your team to prioritize the product changes before you implement them.
