# Design 595 Project 2: Landing an impression
Creating a simple landing page for a client

## Synopsis
You have been approached by an established organization looking to create a microsite/landing page for a small project they have. The goal of the project is to inform specific users about a service or opportunity they are offering, provide a compelling case for the user to participate and finally have so signup or purchase functionality.

In this project, you will go from research all the way to developing a clickable prototype of the website. You will not be expected to code it. 

This will be a project where the early stages will be done in groups. All work for the projects will be done and delivered as a group up to, and including, the wireframes. Each student, however, will develop their own moodboards and clickable prototypes.

## Concepts
- Planning and designing a simple landing page with a signup form
- Basic research for web design project
- Audience identification and personas
- User Experience Flow sketching
- Wireframing
- Visual direction development (Moodboard/style-tile/stylescape)
- Clickable Prototype development

## Project details
Obviously, since this is a class project, things will differ from an IRL project: 

## Client
There will be no real client, so we're doing two things. The instructor and TA will the client contact for the project.  You can ask either any questions and they can offer feedback on any stage of the process. Presentations for the research and planning will be made to the instructor and the TA.

## Research
Since there's no real organization to interview, you can skip this stage of research but as part of the research process deliverable, you will include a list of questions you would ask if they were real.

You can also take the initiative to make a few assumptions during research but don't go nuts. Every decision should be reasonable and suit the audience and goals of your project.

## Brand and content
You won't have access to all the brand materials of visual materials that you might need from the client (since this is a class project). Be resourceful. Feel free to create or improvise brand materials. Get photography from places like Unsplash or other free stock sources. If you're inclined, you can do your own icons and illustrations. 

**Note:** Remember to let the instructor know what materials you've taken from third party sources and what you might have created yourself.

## Do’s
- Research the organization and learn as much as you can about them. Learn their brand, how they look, how they speak.
- It's ok to define a single audience for this project, but be specific.
- Remember: a good landing page explains *what it is, how it works and what's in it for the user*. Keep it simple!
- Define and design the entire process from start to finish, including any signup, registration or purchase process (ie: User Flow).
- Author original text content for the website.
- Though the brand is established, you are free to push the boundaries of it to develop this website. It should feel distinct from the brand but not appear completely separate and disconnected.  
- You have two presentations in this project. Prepare and rehearse them, because in a real-project scenario, presentations are where you gain or lose the trust of the client — plus you're being marked on the presentation.  

## Don't’s
- The organization already has a website. Don't reinvent or duplicate functionality on the project you are executing.
- Don't agonize over the moodboards. Knock them out quickly, let them sit for a day and refine them a bit. 
- Don't create one moodboard you would **love** to design and another that feels like throwaway because the client will always pick the throwaway.
- Don't underestimate the power of good form design.


## Deliverables
- Research process outline (Describe what things you do as part of your research and a script of questions you would ask the interviewees)
- Research report brief (definition of audience, goals, strategies, user personas) 
- Planning documentation: user flow diagrams, wireframes, moodboards (two for each team member)
- Clickable prototype (one from each team member)
- Learning reflection (one from each team member)

## Stretch goal deliverables
- Create a prototype for desktop and mobile  
- Make your own icons or illustrations  
- Take your own photography  

## Dates
- Tuesday, October 5 - Project assigned

**Project is worth 30% of your final mark**
