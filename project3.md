# Design 595 Project 3: UX Challenge
Creating a user experience

## Synopsis
For your final 595 project, you will be given a simple, open-ended brief to design a digital experience around a certain subject. What you choose to do or how far you choose to push it is up to you. Decisions such as branding, choice of audience/demographic, writing content and the details of the interaction will be yours.

The minimum expectation is that you will go from research, to sitemap/wireframes/moodboards, all the way to developing a clickable prototype of a single **but complete** user flow through the digital experience. You will not be expected to code it. 

## Concepts
- Planning and designing a digital experience which answers a brief  
- Basic research for web design project   
- Audience identification and personas   
- User Experience Flow sketching   
- Wireframing     
- Sitemap development   
- Visual direction development (Moodboard/style-tile/stylescape)   
- Clickable Prototype development   

## Project details
Obviously, since this is a class project, things will differ from an IRL project: 

## Client
There will be no real client, so we're doing two things. The instructor and teaching assistant will the client contact for the project. In addition one classmate (selected at random) will also act as a client contact. You can ask either any questions and they can offer feedback on any stage of the process. Presentations will be made to the instructor and the student.

## Research
Since there's no real organization to interview, you can skip this stage of research but you can email a list of questions to the instructor you would like answers for.

Focus your research on the users and the definition of user persons. Use these to help define the brand, language and user flow of the website.

You can also take the initiative to make a few assumptions during research but don't go nuts. Every decision should be reasonable and suit the audience and goals of your project.

## Brand and content
You will be expected to develop the website's brand and text content for the prototype. 

Get photography from places like Unsplash or other free stock sources. For product imagery, be resourceful and find products which you can remove branding and rebrand as the imaginary company's. If you're inclined, you can do your own icons and illustrations. 

**Note:** Remember to let the instructor know what materials you've taken from third party sources and what you might have created yourself.

## Do’s
- You are trying to sell something so ensure the experience is compelling.
- Consider the digital experience from the start to finish!
- Push this project as far as you can. Take chances!
- Learn a bit about the product or service you're being asked to help promote or sell. Make sure your imagery and language suit it and the audience you identify.
- Look at the competition and see what they're doing and how you can do it better.
- The branding/visual approach for this project is wide open! Choose an audience and make the brand work for them!

## Don't’s
- Don't pick yourself or someone like you as the audience. That's lame.
- Don't feel tied to the idea this has to be a website... maybe it's a phone app or an in-store kiosk. 
- Don't design every page necessary for the website/app/kiosk/whatever; only the ones necessary to express a single, linear user flow through the experience. That said, the site map should inventory all the necessary pages for the organization to function.

## Deliverables
- Research report brief (definition of audience, goals, strategies, user personas) - pdf
- Planning documentation and presentation (site map, wireframes, brand and website moodboard) - presentation and pdf
- Clickable prototype
- Case Study (pdf)

## Stretch goal deliverables
