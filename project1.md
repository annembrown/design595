# Design 595 Project 1: Pleased to Meet Me
Creating a simple landing page for yourself
## Synopsis
Your instructor has no clue who you are and, in fact, most people in the design industry don't either. While having different social media accounts can give you a bit of a presence on the web, having a webpage to call home can be a great way to tie everything together. This page should express who your are, what you do and why people should care about you.

For your first project, you will create a simple landing page that includes a well-written biography, a professional photograph of yourself, documentation of accomplishments and experiences, contact information and links to your social media, portfolio or whatever helps express who you are. If there are other things you want to include (samples of your work, more photography, details of your personal interests, etc), go for it. 

**You are telling the story of you and you have complete control of telling that story on this webpage. Make it amazing.**
## Process
- Plan out what you want to present first by sketching some simple wireframe (on paper or in XD)
- Identify your audience
- Write all the content for the page 
- Develop a design language that you'll use for the site (in XD)
- Frame out all the content on html
- Apply design to webpage using CSS
## Things nice to see
- considered approach to the typography
- a non-default typeface
- typographic structure using at least three levels of headings (h1, h2, h3)

## Concepts

## Tips and Extra Stuff
