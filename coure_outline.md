## Expectations
It is the responsibility of students to be on time for class, respectful of other students and instructors and to hand in work on time. Students are expected to keep track of assignments and deadlines and to be prepared for class critiques. Your presence during assigned class times; courteous and thoughtful participation in discussions; and timely completion of assignments are essential to the successful completion of this course. Students who choose not to attend classes must assume whatever risks are involved (see the University Calendar § 23.3 and 23.5.5).
## Evaluation
The primary criterion for assessment and grading is the quality of the completed projects, but other important elements will count towards evaluation of student performance. These elements are: punctuality, attendance, effective use of class time, and class participation in discussions and critiques.

A progress grade will be provided mid-term and / or at the end of each project. A tentative final grade will be given at the end of the course. (Grades are tentative until they become registered at the Registrar’s Office.)

Circumstances may develop during the term where a change to the course outline is necessary. Changes to the course outline, including possible changes to the nature and requirements of projects, will occur, only with fair notice, or general class consent. (See Section 61.6 (a) of the GFC Policy Manual) Policy regarding course outlines can be found in § 23.4(2) of the University Calendar. (GFC 29 SEP 2003). If you have a concern about the general course information, or any other aspect of the course, you are advised to consult, in turn, the instructor, the VCD coordinator, the Chair of the Department of Art & Design, and the Dean of the Faculty of Arts.

## Departmental Guidelines
#### Academic Integrity & Honesty
“The University of Alberta is committed to the highest standards of academic integrity and honesty. Students are expected to be familiar with these standards regarding academic honesty and to uphold the policies of the University in this respect. Students are particularly urged to familiarize themselves with the provisions of the Code of Student Behaviour (www.governance.ualberta.ca) and avoid any behaviour which could potentially result in suspicions of cheating, plagiarism, misrepresentation of facts and/or participation in an offence. Academic dishonesty is a serious offence and can result in suspension or expulsion from the University.” (GFC 29 SEP 2003)
Audio or video recording, digital or otherwise, of lectures, labs, seminars or any other teaching environment by students is allowed only with the prior written consent of the instructor or as a part of an approved accommodation plan. Student or instructor content, digital or otherwise, created and/ or used within the context of the course is to be used solely for personal study, and is not to be used or distributed for any other purpose without prior written consent from the content author(s).

Note that no student shall represent another’s substantial editorial or compositional assistance on an assignment as their own.
